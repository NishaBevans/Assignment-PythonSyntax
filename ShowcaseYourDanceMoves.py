#Task 1: Code Correction Below is a piece of Python code with incorrect indentation. Your task is to correct it.

weather = "sunny"

if weather == "sunny":
    print("Wear sunglasses!")
else:
    print("Take an umbrella!")

#Task 2: Your Mood Today Ask the user how they feel today. If they say "happy", print "That's great to hear!", and if they say "sad", print "I hope your day gets better!". Ensure your if statement is properly indented.

happy = True
sad = False
user =input ("How Are You Today?")
if happy:
    print("That's great to hear!")
if sad:
    print("I hope your day gets better")
## Unsure of what I am doing wrong. Can only get the first response to work 100% properly.
